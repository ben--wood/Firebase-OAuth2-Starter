# LoveField-Starter

Ionic Framework Starter app which uses Firebase as a backing store. OAuth2 flows with Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Github.  Lovefield is used to manipulate data rather than $firebaseObjects and $firebaseArrays

Lovefield is a relational database for web apps built by Google. It's written in JavaScript, works cross-browser and provides SQL-like APIs that are fast, safe, and easy to use. 

This Starter demonstrates LoveField SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE functionality and provides an Angular service to manage the LoveField database connection. No need for a plugin to get SQL-like functionality in Ionic Apps.
