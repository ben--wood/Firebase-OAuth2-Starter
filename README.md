# LoveField-Starter

Ionic Framework Starter app integrated with Lovefield. Lovefield is a relational database for web apps built by Google. It's written in JavaScript, works cross-browser and provides SQL-like APIs that are fast, safe, and easy to use. 

This Starter demonstrates LoveField SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE functionality and provides an Angular service to manage the LoveField database connection. No need for a plugin to get SQL-like functionality in Ionic Apps.
