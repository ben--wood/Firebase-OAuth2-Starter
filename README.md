# Firebase-OAuth2-Starter

Ionic Framework Starter app which uses Firebase as a backing store. OAuth2 flows for Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Github. Lovefield is used to manipulate data rather than $firebaseObjects and $firebaseArrays.

Lovefield is a relational database for web apps built by Google. It's written in JavaScript, works cross-browser and provides SQL-like APIs that are fast, safe, and easy to use. 

This Starter demonstrates Firebase Login, Register, Forgot and change password. LoveField SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE functionality and provides an Angular service to manage the Firebase database connection.
